# Project Description*
Our team hopes to make a functional media player with most, if not all, all the functions of a typical media player. This includes but is not limited to:
* Play/Pause button that plays/stops music
* Skip next/previous button that goes to the next or previous song in the queue
* Functionality to create playlists
* Ability to search for songs with search box
* Ability to adjust volume
* Ability to listen to the audio, or if audio is **not allowed**, we will have a method of implementing lyrics

# Project Highlights

### Reinforce
Our project will implement data structures taught during the APCS course, such as ArrayLists and/or doubly-linked lists in order to store music playlists. We will need an algorithm to order to play/shuffle random songs, and also for adding a repeat functionality.

### Showcase
Our project will entail making a GUI/functional UI for the user in order to click buttons and function. This will be done using processing(most likely), and will require the use of different object classes and math to map out.

### Extend
Our project requires us to gather large amounts of data or tap into a database for the music files, and come up with a way to play lyrics.
