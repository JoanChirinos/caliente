# Project Description
Our team hopes to make a functional image/meme library with most, if not all, all the functions of a typical photo viewer/gallery. This includes but is not limited to:
* Play/Pause button that plays/stops playing a slideshow of images/memes
* Skip next/previous button that goes to view the next or previous image
* Functionality to create albums of selected images
* Ability to search for image files by name, import and export image files
* storage of image files on a server(homer xd)
* Shuffle and repeat image slideshows

# Project Highlights

### Reinforce
Our project will implement data structures taught during the APCS course, such as ArrayLists and/or doubly-linked lists in order to store image albums. We will need an algorithm to order to play/shuffle random images, and also for adding a repeat functionality.

### Showcase
Our project will entail making a GUI/functional UI for the user in order to click buttons and function. This will be done using Java Swing/GUI. If this proves to be too difficult, we will try to implement an UI with a different approach.

### Extend
Our project requires us to gather large amounts of image files, and we will need to learn how to use Java Swing to implement the UI.
