Plan Update:

- In order to have a repeat functionality, we use implement the use of a Deque. This way, elements can be popped and appended to the end,
  maintaining the order.
  
- In order to have a shuffling functionality, we will randomly pop off a number of elements in the Deque, and append them in the same order 
  to the end, and this way, random images will be viewed each time.

- Skip and Prev will simply pop and view end of Deque respectively.

- Processing's coordinate system will be used to determine where the user clicks, hence which buttons/regions are to be activated

- Import/export function will have to be researched.

- We will have multiple UIs: a screen for viewing image, an album list/creator, a screen to view the image list in a certain album, and a main
  menu screen.
