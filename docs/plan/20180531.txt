- The most crucial jobs are figuring out how to read in mp3 files and play them silently,
 getting data structures to implement playlists, and making a friendly UI in processing for
 our muted media player.

- The essentials are silence, ability to play mp3, and ability to create playlists and add 
new songs from a library of music.

- In order to make a playlist, we must first figure out how to read in mp3 files or wav files,
then figure out how to silence processing once it plays music. This way we can implement a 
playlist that allows us to queue up songs.

- All essential tasks can be delegated and separated into reading mp3/silencing, data structure
incorporation into playlists, and making processing. There is a possibility for collaboration
in creating playlists as you can have many different kinds such as a single playthrough, repeating, or 
a shuffled version. The processing also requires every other part to be finished.

- We expect a completed project to be available sometime next week. 
5/31/18 we will figure out playing music files and making playlists.
A couple extra days will be alloted if needed. 
Processing shouldn't take too long to finish knowing that we just need
to make buttons.
